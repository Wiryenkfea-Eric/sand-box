# Example cost-optimized configuration for learning:
# enable_nat_gateway   = false   # Saves ~$45/month but no internet for private subnets
# single_nat_gateway   = true    # If NAT enabled, use single gateway to save costs
# enable_vpn_gateway   = false   # Saves ~$36/month unless you need VPN connectivity

# Example production configuration:
# enable_nat_gateway   = true    # Required for private subnet internet access
# single_nat_gateway   = false   # High availability - one NAT per AZ
# enable_vpn_gateway   = true    # If site-to-site connectivity required
